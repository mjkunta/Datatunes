Hello, I'm Maangi Josiah and I'm a data addict. I'm a Finance graduate from the university of Nairobi, Kenya. As a dedicated data analyst, I draw my dopamine from utilizing SQL, R, Python, Power BI, and Excel.

In this blog, I chronicle my data journey, sharing simple yet invaluable tricks I encounter along the way. With my prospects set on graduate school, it may as well serve as a repository for my masters when that time comes.
